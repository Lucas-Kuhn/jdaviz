Synchronous Spectral Pan/Zoom
-----------------------------
Mosviz assumes the 1D and 2D spectra objects share a relationship in spectral space. As a result, the 1D and 2D spectral viewers have their spectral axes (the horizontal x-axis) linked. As you pan and zoom in spectral space (horizontally) in either of the two spectral viewers, the other will follow, simultaneously panning and zooming by the same amounts.

.. warning::
    If you pan too far away from the bounds of the dataset provided in the 1D or 2D spectral viewers, a warning will be displayed to notify the user. If you go too far, there is a risk of desynchronizing the two viewers.
