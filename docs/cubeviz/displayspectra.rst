Displaying Spectra
******************

A collapsed spectrum of the cube displayed in the upper-left viewer
automatically appears in the 1D spectrum viewer, using the Maximum
collapse method.  The collapse method can be changed in the Viewer
tab of the :guilabel:`Gear` icon in the spectrum viewer. Additional spectra
can be loaded into the spectrum viewer, as detailed in the linked documentation
below.
