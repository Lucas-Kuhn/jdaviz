Displaying Images
*****************

Imviz uses image viewers to visualize data from compatible files.

Selecting Data Set
==================

        Documentation on selecting data sets in the jdaviz viewers.

Adding New Viewers
==================

In the toolbar towards the top of the UI, there is a :guilabel:`picture with +` icon. By
clicking this icon, you can add new viewers to the application. You can then select from the data
that has been loaded into the application to be visualized in these extra viewers. You can then utilize some of the
Imviz-specific features, like Linked Pan/Zoom.

Defining Spatial Regions
========================

Spatial regions can be created the same way as in Cubeviz.

Blinking
========

Blinking is an Imviz-specific functionality that allows a user to quickly switch
between viewing two images. This can be done by selecting the :guilabel:`hammer and screwdriver` icon
and then clicking the :guilabel:`right arrow` icon. You can also access blinking
by selecting the "B" key on your keyboard.

Pan/Zoom and Linked Pan/Zoom
============================

Linked pan zoom is an Imviz-specific feature that allows the user to Pan and Zoom
images in multiple different viewers simultaneously. This works by matching images
based on their WCS (if present) or linking images by pixel.

Regular Pan/Zoom is also available and is used similarly to other jdaviz tools.
