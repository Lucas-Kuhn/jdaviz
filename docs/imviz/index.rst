Imviz is a tool for visualization and analysis of 2D astronomical images.
It incorporates visualization tools with analysis capabilities, such as Astropy regions and photutils packages.
Users can interact with their data from within the tool.
Imviz also provides programmatic access to its viewers using
`Astrowidgets <https://astrowidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ API.
See `~jdaviz.core.astrowidgets_api.AstrowidgetsImageViewerMixin` for available functionality.
Data can be both imported into and exported out of the tool so users can continue their desired workflow within the notebook.
This documentation provides details on the various capabilities, demo videos, and example notebooks.
